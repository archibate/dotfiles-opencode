# Test Feasibility Brainstorm

For making a plan of TDD development, do feasibility study by brainstorming on:
- How this spec can be tested?
- How to set up unit tests?
- How to set up integration tests?
- How to set up end-to-end tests?
- What are the edge cases?
- How to ensure test coverage?
- What are the dependencies (real-world I/O) in this spec?
- How to mock these dependencies?
- How to ensure the mocks fully aligns with real-world dependencies?
- Are there anything untestable?
- Any test framework for our tech stack?
- Is the test fully automated?
- If some tests are not possible to be automated, how can we test manually?
- For interactive applications, how can we test it interactively?
